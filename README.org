* lss - ls, but worse
So, that saying... don't reinvent the wheel.

Well, you see...

Ehh...

...
* Features
[[file:./med/example-screenshot_2021-12-05.png]]
- Dynamically fills screen with file names, spaced nicely (mostly).
- Sort files alphabetically, left to right, top to bottom.
- No option to not show hidden files, a very honest program...
- The long flag puts spaces between some file names in a deterministic yet odd way, for your reading pleasure. It's totally not a bug.

* Manual
** Downloading
*** git HTTPS
To get the latest version with git over HTTPS:
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/cafkafk/lss.git
#+end_src
*** git SSH
To get the latest version with git over SSH:
#+begin_src sh
git clone git@github.com:cafkafk/lss.git
#+end_src

** Building
*** Linux
**** Compiling
Navigate to your local copy of the repository. When you're in the root directory,
simply run:
#+begin_src sh
make
#+end_src

And the binary will be built for you in the local directory. You can then move it to any place in your path if you wanna have acces to it globally.
**** Cleaning
Navigate to your local copy of the repository. When you're in the root directory,
simply run:
#+begin_src sh
make clean
#+end_src

This will remove any residual files from compilation as well as the binary.

** Usage
To use =lss=, just run:
#+begin_src sh
./lss
#+end_src

And you will see the local directory. If you prefer a longer list format:
#+begin_src sh
./lss -l
#+end_src

More options are WIP.
